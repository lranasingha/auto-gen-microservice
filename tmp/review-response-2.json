The code does not have any comments or documentation, which could make it difficult for other developers to understand what the code is doing.\n\n3. The code does not have any error handling for cases where the terminal with the given ID is not found in the repository. It would be good to add a check for this and throw an appropriate exception.\n\n4. The code uses a raw type for the Record object, which could lead to type safety issues. It would be better to use a parameterized type instead.\n\n5. The code could benefit from some refactoring to make it more readable and maintainable. For example, the mapTerminalRecordToTerminalModel method could be moved to a separate mapper class."
